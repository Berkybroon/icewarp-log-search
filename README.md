I made this script a while ago to identify anomalous activity on a managed IceWarp server.  
Doubt anyone else will find it useful, but I wanted to stick it somewhere so I could remove it from my local disk  
  
Usage:  
Copy the script and the log file to the same folder  
Rename log file simply to 'log' (no filename extension) and run the script  
Check the newly created text file "top_50.txt" for the output.
